SuperStoreDataAnalysis
I’m excited to share my first project as part of the Elevvo Pathways Data Analytics Program a comprehensive Superstore Sales Dashboard built entirely in Excel.
This interactive dashboard provides valuable insights into business performance, including:
 📊 Monthly Sales Trends
 💰 Total Sales & Profit Overview
 🏢 Segment-wise Performance (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)
 🌎 Regional Sales Distribution
 📈 Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth
🔧 Tools & Techniques Used:
Excel Pivot Tables & Charts
Slicers for interactivity
Conditional Formatting
Dashboard Design & KPI Visualization
This project helped me strengthen my data visualization, Excel analytics, and business insight storytelling skills and setting a strong foundation for my data analytics journey.
A huge thanks to Elevvo Pathways for providing the guidance and structure to make this possible. 🙌
